## Project Context

This document outlines the discovery and planning for improving the user experience flow of the Agentic Cost Calculator application. The current interface has several usability issues that need to be addressed while maintaining the existing calculation logic and template system architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Issues

- **Clunky Template Selection**: Templates are buried within the form as a "Quick Start" section rather than being prominently featured
- **Confusing Parameter Split**: The division between one-off projects, ongoing usage, and combined scenarios creates user confusion
- **No Guided Journey**: Users are presented with a complex form immediately without guidance on what they're trying to achieve
- **Poor Information Architecture**: All form fields are visible at once, overwhelming new users

### Current Application Structure

The application currently uses:

- Single-page form with all parameters visible
- Side-by-side input panel and results display
- Template system separate from main code (good for future extensibility)
- Robust calculation engine and API
- Comprehensive form state management via `useCalculatorForm` hook

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Guided User Journey**: Create a step-by-step experience that helps users understand what they're calculating
2. **Template-First Approach**: Make templates prominent with clear examples and use cases
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
4. **Maintain All Features**: Preserve all current calculation capabilities
5. **Export Functionality**: Keep PDF/JSON export options
6. **Template Extensibility**: Maintain separation for future community contributions

### Technical Requirements

1. **Preserve Calculation Logic**: No changes to existing calculation engine
2. **Maintain API Compatibility**: Keep existing server endpoints
3. **Code Maintainability**: Keep implementation simple and robust
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure wizard is accessible and responsive
5. **Performance**: No degradation in calculation performance

### Future Considerations

1. **Community Templates**: Easy submission and management of new templates
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Ability to collect post-project data for template improvement
3. **Template Analytics**: Understanding which templates are most popular/effective

## Proposed Solution: Guided Wizard Flow

### Selected Approach: Linear Step-by-Step Wizard

We've chosen a linear wizard approach as it provides the clearest user experience while being the most straightforward to implement.

```

**Pros**: Adapts to user expertise, maintains simplicity, preserves power user functionality
**Cons**: Complex branching logic, unpredictable user journey, may hide important options

### Pros and Cons of Selected Approach (Linear Wizard)

#### Pros

- **Clear, Predictable Flow**: Users always know what comes next
- **Easy Implementation**: Can reuse existing form state and validation logic
- **Good for First-time Users**: Each step has a single focus
- **Maintainable**: Simple state management and navigation logic
- **Accessible**: Linear flow is easier to make accessible
- **Testable**: Each step can be tested independently

#### Cons

- **May Feel Lengthy**: Experienced users might want to skip steps
- **Less Flexible**: Harder to jump between non-sequential steps
- **Power User Limitation**: Advanced users may find it restrictive

### Mitigation Strategies for Cons

1. **Progress Indicator**: Clear visual progress to set expectations
2. **Step Validation**: Allow users to skip ahead if previous steps are valid
3. **"Advanced Mode" Toggle**: Option to switch to current form-based interface
4. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate based on template selection to reduce steps
5. **Quick Actions**: "Use This Template" buttons that bypass customization

### Phase 3: Enhanced UX & Polish

- [x] **Template Previews Enhancement**
  - [x] In `TemplateStep.tsx`, enhance template previews to show more details (e.g., example calculations, typical use cases, benefits).
  - [x] Implemented rich template gallery with card-based UI
  - [x] Added template-specific icons for visual identification
  - [x] Created expandable template cards with detailed information
  - [x] Added simplified cost estimation previews showing traditional vs agentic savings
  - [x] Included key benefits and use case recommendations for each template
  - [x] Implemented template filtering based on selected project type

  - [x] Maintained accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [x] **Smart Defaults & Pre-population**
  - [x] Implement logic in `ParametersStep.tsx` to intelligently pre-populate form fields based on the selected template, reducing user input.
  - [x] Added smart project naming based on template parameters (e.g., "Quick Development Task", "Development Sprint", "Enterprise Development Initiative")
  - [x] Implemented intelligent customer name suggestions
  - [x] Created smart defaults info panel with toggle for advanced details
  - [x] Added context-aware project descriptions based on template selection
- [ ] **"Advanced Mode" Toggle (Modify File: `src/client/App.tsx` and `src/client/components/Calculator.tsx`)**
  - [ ] In `src/client/App.tsx` (or a new layout component), implement a UI toggle to switch between the new Wizard UI and the existing single-page form (`Calculator.tsx`).
  - [ ] Ensure `src/client/components/Calculator.tsx` can function as this "Advanced Mode".
  - [ ] Define behaviour for state transfer or reset when toggling modes. Consider how form state is synchronized or transferred if a user starts in the wizard, fills some data, and then switches to Advanced Mode, and vice-versa (a full state transfer might be simplest if the underlying `formState` is common).
- [ ] **UI Polish & Responsiveness**
  - [ ] Review and refine animations and transitions between wizard steps for a smooth user experience.
  - [ ] Ensure all wizard steps and new components are fully responsive across common device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- [x] **Accessibility (WCAG)**
  - [x] Conduct an accessibility review of the entire wizard flow.
  - [x] Ensure proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
  - [x] Added proper navigation landmarks with semantic nav elements
  - [x] Implemented comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions for all interactive elements
  - [x] Added screen reader support with sr-only hints and instructions
  - [x] Enhanced focus management and keyboard navigation throughout
- [x] **Navigation Enhancements**
  - [x] Ensure browser back/forward buttons work intuitively with wizard steps, preserving state where appropriate.
  - [x] Added URL-based step navigation with browser history integration
  - [x] Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Alt+Arrow keys) for wizard navigation
  - [x] Enhanced step navigation with progress indicators and visual feedback
  - [x] Added responsive navigation with mobile-friendly progress bars

### Testing Strategy Implementation

- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for each new wizard step component (e.g., `WelcomeStep.tsx`, `UseCaseStep.tsx`).
  - [ ] Write unit tests for new hooks (`useWizardState.ts`, `useStepValidation.ts`).
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `WizardProvider.tsx` state management and integration with `useCalculatorForm`.
- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Develop integration tests for the complete wizard flow: Welcome -> Use Case -> Template -> Model -> Parameters -> Review -> Results.
  - [ ] Test navigation logic (Next, Previous, conditional enabling).
  - [ ] Test data persistence and updates across wizard steps.
  - [ ] Test scenarios where users navigate back and forth between wizard steps, ensuring data persistence and correct re-population of fields.
  - [ ] Test the interaction between the wizard's "Calculate" action and the backend API via `useCalculatorForm`.
  - [ ] Test template application and its effect on pre-filling parameters, including edge cases like selecting a template, making modifications, then selecting another.
  - [ ] Test the "Advanced Mode" toggle and its interaction with the wizard.
- [ ] **Regression Tests**
  - [ ] Ensure all existing calculation tests in `src/shared/utils/__tests__/` continue to pass.
  - [ ] Verify that the "Advanced Mode" (if it reuses `Calculator.tsx`) maintains its original functionality and passes any associated tests.
